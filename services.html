                        <p class="card-text">CSA offers a comprehensive zero-trust access solution with full security
                             inspection (web filtering, AV, IPS, malware protection, and CASB). It includes Universal ZTNA,
                              identity, multi-factor authentication, continuous posture assessment, adaptive and granular 
                              application access, and network access control (NAC). Our Universal ZTNA goes above and 
                              beyond industry-standard cloud-only ZTNA for remote access. Our offering provides flexible secure 
                              access to corporate and SaaS applications from all locations where a user might be working. To address
                               the complexity, cost, and security gaps caused when deploying multiple endpoint solutions, CSA offers 
                               a single, integrated unified agent that combines secure access with ZTNA, endpoint protection (EPP), 
                               and endpoint detection and response (EDR). With the unified FortiClient endpoint agent, you can move 
                               from VPN to ZTNA and on-board applications at your own pace. In addition, integrated IT hygiene, endpoint
                               protection, and secure application access capabilities, including vulnerability scanning, AV, web filtering, 
                               EDR, and sandbox integration, are included. CSA zero-trust controls integrate with the Fortinet Security 
                               Fabric to deliver automated and simplified operations. CSA acts as Fabric Agent to provide telemetry and
                                endpoint visibility, along with posture with the FortiClient Endpoint Management Server (EMS). Our EMS 
                                connects with the Fabric to communicate near real-time endpoint information to all Fortinet zero-trust 
                                enforcement points that are part of the Fabric. </p>
